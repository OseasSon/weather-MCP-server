# Weather MCP Server for Intercom

Custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates weather tools with Intercom.

## üéØ What This Is

This project demonstrates how to build a custom MCP server that integrates with Intercom. Use it as a template for:
- **Learning MCP development** with real-world examples
- **Building your own tools** by replacing weather APIs with your data sources
- **Product demos** showing MCP capabilities

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Read the setup guide**: [`SETUP_GUIDE.md`](./SETUP_GUIDE.md)
2. **Start the server**: `uv run weather.py`

## üõ†Ô∏è What It Provides

### Weather Tools for Intercom Fin
- **`greet`** - Personalized customer greetings
- **`get_alerts`** - Real-time weather alerts for US states
- **`get_forecast`** - Detailed weather forecasts by coordinates

### Technical Features
- **Real-time data** from National Weather Service API
- **HTTP transport** via ngrok tunneling
- **Async operations** for optimal performance
- **Error handling** with graceful fallbacks

## üìã Files Overview

- **`weather.py`** - Main MCP server implementation
- **`SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - Complete setup instructions for team
- **`pyproject.toml`** - Python project configuration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

Due to [MCP SDK bug #423](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/issues/423), you may need to apply a simple patch to enable tool discovery. This bug may be fixed in future SDK releases. Full instructions in the setup guide.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **FastMCP** - MCP server framework
- **Python 3.11+** - Runtime environment
- **httpx** - HTTP client for weather API
- **ngrok** - HTTP tunneling
